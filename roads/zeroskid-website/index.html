# ZeroSkid – Wet vs. Dry Road Classifier

## Problem & Motivation
Hydroplaning accidents happen fast and often because drivers can't always tell how wet a road really is.  
My goal with ZeroSkid is to build a simple AI model that can classify road conditions as *wet* or *dry* so drivers and vehicle systems can react early.

## Dataset Description
I created my own dataset of wet and dry road images.  
The images came from online sources and were organized into two folders:
- `wet/`
- `dry/`

All images were resized to 224×224 and normalized for AlexNet.

Because my dataset is small, this project focuses on testing how well AlexNet can learn from limited data and how different settings affect performance.

## Technical Approach (AlexNet)
I used PyTorch in Google Colab and implemented a modified AlexNet model trained on my custom dataset.

The process included:
- Loading data from Google Drive
- Random horizontal flips for augmentation
- Normalization for AlexNet
- Training for 20+ epochs
- Running multiple experiments:
  - different batch sizes  
  - different learning rates  
  - with vs. without augmentation  
  - AlexNet vs. ResNet18  

All experiments were logged using Weights & Biases.

# 🔍 Confusion Matrix
This shows how well the model classified wet vs. dry images.

![Confusion Matrix](images/confusion_matrix.png)

The model is extremely strong at recognizing **wet** roads but sometimes confuses dry roads as wet.  
For safety applications, false-wet predictions are better than false-dry.

# 📌 Key Takeaways
- AlexNet can learn wet vs. dry road features even with a small dataset.  
- Data augmentation improves performance significantly.  
- ResNet18 performed slightly better than AlexNet.  
- The model is biased toward predicting "wet," which is safer for driver alerts.
