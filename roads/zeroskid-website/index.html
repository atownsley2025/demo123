      <h1>ZeroSkid: Detecting Wet Roads with Deep Learning</h1>
      <p>
        ZeroSkid is a proof-of-concept project that uses computer vision to tell whether a road
        surface is <strong>wet</strong> or <strong>dry</strong>. The idea connects to a larger safety
        concept: if a car can recognize dangerous wet conditions in real time, it can warn the driver
        or adjust driving behavior to reduce the chance of hydroplaning.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Wet roads are a big safety issue, especially when drivers do not realize how slippery the
        surface actually is. Many crashes happen because the road looks “normal” until a car hits a
        slick patch of water and loses traction. Most current systems focus on speed or distance to
        other cars, but do not really look at the <em>road surface itself</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My project focuses on a simpler but important sub-problem: can we train a model to visually
        tell the difference between a wet road and a dry road using images?
      </p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The motivation behind ZeroSkid is to explore how AI could help prevent accidents before they
        happen. If a model can recognize wet conditions from a camera feed, it could be part of a
        system that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Warns the driver when the road is potentially unsafe</li>
        <li>Adjusts cruise control or braking behavior on wet surfaces</li>
        <li>Helps insurance and safety systems better understand driving conditions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project is not a full product yet. It is a small, controlled version of the idea that
        focuses on image classification as a first step toward smarter road-condition awareness.

      <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, I created a custom dataset with two classes: <strong>wet</strong> and
        <strong>dry</strong> roads. Each image shows a road surface and is labeled based on its
        condition. The images are stored in folders like <code>train/wet</code>, <code>train/dry</code>,
        <code>test/wet</code>, and <code>test/dry</code>. All images are resized to 224×224 pixels and
        normalized so they can be used with AlexNet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dataset is fairly small, which makes training a bit noisy, but it is realistic for a
        student project and still gives the model enough information to learn meaningful patterns
        between wet and dry road surfaces.

      <p>
        This page explains the problem and motivation. The
        <a href="technical.html">Technical Approach</a> page goes into more detail about the model,
        experiments, and results using AlexNet and ResNet18.
