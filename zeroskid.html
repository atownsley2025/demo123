    <h1>ZeroSkid: Wet-Road Detection with AlexNet</h1>
    <p>
      ZeroSkid is an assistive driving system that uses computer vision and deep learning to detect wet pavement
      in real time. Wet roads cause thousands of preventable crashes every year. The goal of this project is to
      warn drivers before traction is lost.

      <h2>Problem & Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Wet pavement is a serious but often overlooked hazard. It contributes to a large number of crashes each year,
        along with major financial and emotional costs.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Current systems like ABS and traction control only react after a skid has started.</li>
        <li>Drivers can’t always see thin layers of water, puddles, or slick surfaces, especially at night.</li>
        <li>There is a clear need for proactive, real-time detection of wet-road conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="stats">
        Crash statistics commonly report:<br>
        &bull; Hundreds of thousands of wet-road crashes per year<br>
        &bull; Over five hundred thousand injuries annually<br>
        &bull; Thousands of deaths that could be reduced with better warnings
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is motivated by the idea that AI and computer vision can help close the gap between what cars detect
        and what drivers can safely respond to in time.
      </p>

    <section id="solution">
      <h2>ZeroSkid Device & Solution Overview</h2>
      <p>
        ZeroSkid proposes a small add-on device that uses a dash-mounted camera and an onboard deep learning model
        to classify the road ahead as dry or wet.
      </p>
      <h3>Core Ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Camera-based sensing of the lane ahead.</li>
        <li>Real-time classification of road conditions (wet vs. dry).</li>
        <li>Audio or visual alerts when wet pavement is detected.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Who Could Benefit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Everyday drivers in rain-heavy regions (for example, Florida).</li>
        <li>Insurance partners trying to reduce crash risk.</li>
        <li>Fleet and delivery operators who want fewer accidents and less downtime.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="technical">
      <h2>Technical Approach: Using AlexNet</h2>
      <p>
        ZeroSkid uses AlexNet, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), to classify images of the road as wet or dry.
        AlexNet is well-suited to this task because its convolutional layers can learn visual patterns like texture,
        reflections, and edges on the pavement.
      </p>
      <h3>Architecture Summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>5 convolutional layers for feature extraction.</li>
        <li>3 fully connected layers for final classification.</li>
        <li>ReLU activations and max pooling to improve learning and reduce noise.</li>
        <li>Softmax output layer for predicting wet vs. dry.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How It Helps</h3>
      <p>
        Early convolutional layers focus on edges and simple patterns; deeper layers pick up more complex textures
        and reflections. This layered processing helps the network distinguish between normal dry pavement and
        the shinier, more reflective look of wet roads.
      </p>

    <section id="training">
      <h2>Training Process & Data</h2>
      <p>
        The model is trained on labeled images of roads under wet and dry conditions. During training, AlexNet learns
        to connect visual patterns in the images with the correct label.
      </p>
      <h3>Training Setup</h3>
      <div class="code-box">
        Input data: Wet &amp; dry road images<br>
        Loss function: Cross-entropy loss<br>
        Optimizer: SGD or Adam<br>
        Learning rate: ~0.001<br>
        Batch size: 32<br>
        Epochs: 10–30 (depending on dataset size)
      </div>
      <h3>Data & Preprocessing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Images from different times of day and weather conditions.</li>
        <li>Mix of highways, city streets, and parking lots.</li>
        <li>All images resized to 224×224×3 RGB to match AlexNet.</li>
        <li>Pixel values normalized for more stable training.</li>
        <li>Data augmentation (brightness changes, rotations, flips) to improve generalization.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="results">

        Colab (such as accuracy curves or example predictions) can also be added in this section.
