      <h1>ZeroSkid: Wet vs Dry Road Classifier</h1>
      <p>
        ZeroSkid is my deep learning project where I trained a model to tell if a road surface is 
        <strong>wet</strong> or <strong>dry</strong> from images. The goal is to explore how computer vision 
        could help warn drivers about unsafe road conditions before drivers actually lose control.

      <h2>🚗 Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Hydroplaning happens fast, especially when the road looks “normal” but is actually slick. A lot of the time,
        drivers only realize how bad the road is once they are already sliding. Most driver-assist systems focus on
        other cars, lanes, or speed – not on the texture or condition of the road surface itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The smaller question I wanted to test was simple: <strong>can a model look at an image of the road and decide if it’s wet or dry?</strong>
        If that works, it could eventually be built into a safety system that reacts earlier than a human would.

      <h2>💡 Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve always been interested in the idea of using AI for safety instead of just for convenience. Wet roads are
        a really common problem, but drivers don’t always adjust their behavior until it’s too late. If a car’s camera
        could recognize a dangerous surface, it could:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Warn the driver when the road looks risky</li>
        <li>Adjust things like cruise control or braking on wet roads</li>
        <li>Help make smarter, condition-aware driving systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ZeroSkid is not a full product, but this project is one realistic step: building and testing a classifier that
        understands the difference between wet and dry road images.

      <h2>📂 Dataset Overview</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, I created a small custom dataset with two labels: <strong>wet</strong> and <strong>dry</strong>. 
        The images came from online sources and were organized into folders:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>train/wet</code> and <code>train/dry</code></li>
        <li><code>valid/wet</code> and <code>valid/dry</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Every image was resized to <strong>224×224</strong> and normalized so it works with AlexNet. Because the
        dataset is small, part of the project is just seeing how much performance we can squeeze out of limited data
        using techniques like transfer learning and data augmentation.

      <h2>📄 What’s on the Next Page?</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="technical.html">Technical Approach page</a> explains how I used AlexNet and ResNet18, which
        experiments I ran in Colab, and how the model actually performed. It also includes visualizations, plots from
        Weights &amp; Biases, and my main takeaways from the results.
