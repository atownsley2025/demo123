# ZeroSkid – Wet vs. Dry Road Classifier

## 🚗 Problem & Motivation
Hydroplaning accidents happen because drivers often cannot see how wet or slippery a road really is.  
ZeroSkid is a small-scale project exploring whether a deep learning model can classify a road surface as **wet** or **dry** using images. The idea is a first step toward real systems that could warn drivers or automatically adjust vehicle behavior.

# 📂 Dataset Description
I created a custom dataset with two labels:

- **wet**
- **dry**

All images:
- were collected from online sources  
- resized to 224×224  
- normalized for AlexNet  
- split into training and validation folders  

Because the dataset is small, the focus is on how hyperparameters and augmentation affect performance.

# 🧠 Technical Approach (AlexNet)
I trained a modified AlexNet model using PyTorch in Google Colab.  
Key steps:

- Load dataset from Google Drive  
- Apply preprocessing: resizing, normalization  
- Apply optional augmentation: horizontal flip  
- Train AlexNet for 20+ epochs  
- Compare experiments:
  - Batch size changes  
  - Learning rate changes  
  - Augmentation vs no augmentation  
  - AlexNet vs ResNet18  
- Log every experiment with Weights & Biases  

All results below come from those runs.

# 🔍 Confusion Matrix (Best Model)
This shows how well the model predicted each class.

**Interpretation:**  
The model is very strong at identifying **wet** roads, but sometimes misclassifies **dry** roads as wet.  
For safety applications, false-wet predictions are much safer than false-dry, so this bias is acceptable.

# 📌 Key Takeaways
- AlexNet can learn useful features even from a small dataset.  
- Data augmentation significantly improves accuracy.  
- The model performs best with a lower learning rate.  
- ResNet18 gave slightly better performance than AlexNet.  
- The model is safer when it errs on predicting “wet.”
